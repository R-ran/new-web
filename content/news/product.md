# 304 Stainless Steel - Your Industrial Solution

304 stainless steel is the backbone of modern manufacturing, offering exceptional durability, corrosion resistance, and versatility. At **Your Company**, we specialize in stocking the full spectrum of 304 stainless steel products—ensuring you have access to the highest quality materials for your needs. From precision-cut 304 stainless steel sheets to mirror-smooth 304 2B stainless steel, high-tonnage 304 stainless steel coils, mandrel-bent 304 stainless steel exhaust tubing, and leak-proof 304 stainless steel fittings, we offer a comprehensive range of products that meet **ASTM A240/A276**, **EN 1.4301**, and **ANSI B16.9** standards.

Each product is manufactured with a certified 18% Cr / 8% Ni chemistry for maximum corrosion resistance, ensuring optimal performance in applications like food tanks, coastal panels, chemical trailers, and high-temperature exhaust lines.

## 304 Stainless Steel Specifications

| Grade | Cr | Ni | C (max) | Salt-Spray Life | Food-Safe |
|-------|----|----|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| **304** | 18% | 8% | 0.08% | ≥1,000 hours | YES |
| **201** | 16% | 1% | 0.15% | ≈250 hours | Conditional |

Why do global OEMs prefer our 304 stainless steel? Its superior performance speaks for itself:

- **Corrosion Resistance**: Our 304 stainless steel outperforms 201 by 5–7x in salt-spray tests. With <0.1% rust after 1,000 hours, it maintains a clean, corrosion-free finish.
- **Food-Safe Compliance**: Our 304 stainless steel is fully FDA and EU 10/2011 compliant, ensuring it’s genuinely safe for food contact. Unlike 201, it doesn’t contain harmful Mn sulfide stringers, which can lead to bacterial contamination.
- **Formability**: With a tensile strength of 75 ksi and 40% elongation, 304 stainless steel can be deep-drawn, spun, or TIG-welded without cracks. Our 304 2B stainless steel arrives with a surface finish of Ra ≤0.4 µm, perfect for powder coating or sanitary polishing.

**Logistics**: We provide 2,000 tons of 304 stainless steel coil (0.3–6.0 mm) slit to ±0.1 mm and packed in eye-to-sky arrangements to prevent damage during ocean freight.

Need exhaust systems? Our 304 stainless steel exhaust tubing is mandrel-bent, 320-grit OD-polished, and heat-number traceable—ideal for high-performance applications. Similarly, our 304 stainless steel fittings—elbows, tees, tri-clamps—are solution-annealed to ≤0.030% C, preventing intergranular corrosion.
