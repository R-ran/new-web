## 201 Stainless Steel vs 304 Stainless Steel

When buyers first search for "201 stainless steel vs 304 stainless steel," they often find two quotes that seem nearly identical—except one is 8% cheaper. But this discount could turn into a **300% replacement cost** once corrosion sets in. Let’s break down the science, economics, and real-world failures that show why **304 stainless steel** is the only logical choice.

## 201 vs 304 Stainless Steel

The difference lies in their **chemistry**. Grade 201 replaces nickel (Ni) with 4–6% manganese (Mn) to cut cost. The result? A steel that lacks the dense chromium oxide layer required for superior corrosion resistance. In salt-spray testing, 201 shows 1.5% rust after 1,000 hours, while our 304 stainless steel sheets show less than 0.1%.

For a coastal kitchen hood, this means that 201 will start to tea-stain within months, while **304 stainless steel** will stay clean for over five years.

## 304 Stainless Steel vs 201 Stainless Steel

Mechanically, the differences are even more pronounced. Annealed 304 stainless steel boasts a tensile strength of **75 ksi** with **40% elongation**, perfect for deep-drawn sinks or exhaust tubing. By comparison, 201 tops out at **65 ksi** and **32% elongation**, causing higher springback and potential micro-cracking.

One OEM reduced scrap from **12% to 2%** after switching to our 304 stainless steel, resulting in savings of $0.14 per part—even after factoring in the nickel premium.

| **Automotive Exhaust Test**        | **201 Stainless Steel** | **304 Stainless Steel** |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Weld-seam leaks after 500 thermal cycles | 18%                    | 1%                      |
| Warranty claims per 1,000 units   | 29                      | 3                       |
| Cost of rework                    | $48                     | $7                      |

## 304 Stainless Steel vs 201 Stainless Steel

When it comes to **food safety**, the difference is non-negotiable. The FDA lists 304 stainless steel as "unrestricted food-contact," while 201 is only conditional. 201 contains **Mn-sulfide inclusions**, which can pit under acidic conditions like citrus, creating breeding grounds for bacteria. Our food-grade 304 stainless steel fittings are vacuum solution-annealed to ≤0.030% carbon, then electropolished to Ra ≤0.38 µm, exceeding **3-A Sanitary 63-03** standards.

## 201 Stainless Steel vs 304 Stainless Steel

In terms of **lifetime cost**, 201 may seem like a bargain upfront, but the hidden costs add up fast. A 201 catering table might save $80 initially, but it will rust through in 3–4 years in a humid kitchen environment. A table made from our 304 2B stainless steel will last **15-20 years**, even under daily chlorine exposure. Over 20 years, 304 stainless steel costs **$0.12 per day** to maintain, while 201 will cost **$0.31 per day**, factoring in replacements and downtime.

Fleet operators report **1.8x longer life** with our 304 stainless steel exhaust tubing, along with **30% lower maintenance costs**.

| **Property**               | **201 Stainless Steel** | **304 Stainless Steel** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Cr Content                 | 16–18%                  | 18–20%                  |
| Ni Content                 | 0–1%                    | 8–10%                   |
| Salt-Spray Life            | 250 hours               | 1,000+ hours            |
| FDA Food Contact           | Conditional             | Unrestricted            |
| 20-Year Cost               | High                    | Lowest                  |
